		The "tapestry5-jquery" is the first open sourced Tapestry 5 library by Atos WorldLine. 
  		It aims to be a total replacement of the Prototype/Scriptaculous JS layer of Tapestry: all its components, mixins or any other JS interactions.
  	</span>
  	<br/><br/>
  	<div>
  		Project is hosted <a href="http://github.com/got5"> Github</a> under the got5 account.
  		Tapestry5-jquery is based on Tapestry 5.2.5, jQuery, jQuery UI or any plugins.
  	</div>
  	<br/><br/>
  		Current project version covers all Tapestry basic components and mixins and already have some exclusives features like the Dialog component.
  		The project was built having also in mind that the integration of this library should be as much as possible transparent for end user.
  		Whenever only JS layers of components where overriden in order to continue to use normal component declaration. 
	<br/><br/>
  		Tapestry 5 has a loose coupling on Prototype and Scriptaculous on a lot of points.
  		But there are some rooms where the coupling is  very tight.
  		This is were this library comes to fix that.
  		The goal of this library is to get rid of Prototype, Scriptaculous on core Tapestry services.
